# Hi there 👋 I’m Shane (ShaneF-Projects)

Welcome to my GitHub! This repo page is a collection of projects that I’ve developed while studying Computer Science. I’m always learning and putting into practice new skills, especially in algorithms, software engineering, and web development.

## 🚀 Repositories & Highlights

Here are some of my key public projects:

| Repo | Description |
|---|---|
| **AlgProj1** | Java project from 2nd year on algorithms — building and analysing algorithm implementations. |
| **SoftEngProject2** | Semester 2 Software Engineering project — collaborating on larger software solutions, practising design, testing, etc. |
| **AlgAssignment** | C programming practicum — assignments focused on data structures, recursion, optimisation. |
| **DirtyDino** | Game project from the Microprocessors course — learned a lot about hardware/software interface, game logic, and cooperating in a team. |
| **WebDevProject1** | My first website project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — a food recipe sharing site with video & image content. |
